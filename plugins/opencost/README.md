# OpenCost

Welcome to the OpenCost plugin!

Currently this is a port of the [OpenCost UI](https://github.com/opencost/opencost/tree/develop/ui), but we will continue to expand it to expose any relevant data or pre-configured views that may be preferred.



## Installation

## Configuration

## TODO

* Document installation and configuration
* More testing
* Use the OpenCost mascot for the sidebar logo
* Use the Backstage proxy to communicate with the OpenCost API
* Convert AllocationReport.js to use the [Backstage Table](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/data-display-table--default-table)
* Allow for user-provided default reports and/or disabling controls
* Support multiple hard-coded reports
* Fork(?) to support Kubecost, which could provide Alerts and Recommendations, similar to the Cost Explorer plugin
* clean up deprecation warnings and upgrade to all the latest React components
